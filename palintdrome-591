Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Write a program that checks whether an integer is a palindrome. For example, 121 is a palindrome, as well as 888. 678 is not a palindrome. Do not convert the integer into a string.



int rev = 0;
int temp = in;
while(temp!=0){
  rev += temp% 10;
	rev *= 10;
	temp /= 10;
}
return(rev==in);
