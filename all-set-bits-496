Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Pivotal.

Write an algorithm that finds the total number of set bits in all integers between 1 and N.



int setbits(int in){
  int t = 0;
	if(in==1){
		++t;
		--n;
	}
	while(in != 0){
		t += (in %2);
		in = in >>1;
	}
	return t;
}
