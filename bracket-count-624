 13 Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parenthes    es to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed    ).
 12                                                                                            11 For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you s    hould return 2, since we must remove all of them.

Connect 4 is a game where opponents take turns dropping red or black discs into a 7 x 6 vertically suspended grid. The game ends either when one player creates a line of four consecutive discs of their color (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when there are no more spots left in the grid.

Design and implement Connect 4.


int i=0;
char c;
int o=0;
int l=0;
while(i < s.length()){
  c = s[i];
	++i;
	if(c=='(')
	  ++o;
  else if(c==')')
	  ++l;
}
int t=o-i;
if(t<0)
  t *= -1;
return t;


//&s is in esi
xor ecx, ecx ;i
xor eax, eax ;(
xor ebx, ebx ;)
loop: mov edx, [esi + ecx]
cmp edx, 0	 ;null termd string
je end
cmp edx, (
caddeq eax, 1
cmp edx, )   ;could this and below be replaced with caddne ebx, 1?
caddeq ebx, 1
inc ecx
jmp loop
end: sub eax, ebx
jge skip
neg eax
skip: ret
