Implement a bit array.

A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of 1 or 0 at each index.

init(size): initialize the array with size
set(i, val): updates index at i with val where val is either 1 or 0.
get(i): gets the value at index i.





uint8_t* init(int size){
  return calloc((size/8)+1);
}

void set(int i, int val){
  switch(val){

			break;
		default:

This problem was asked by Uber.

A rule looks like this:

A NE B

This means this means point A is located northeast of point B.

A SW C

means that point A is southwest of C.

Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate. For example:

A N B
B NE C
C N A
does not validate, since A cannot be both north and south of C.

A NW B
A N B
is considered valid.

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square cells. Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply:

Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run for. Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since it's an infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the top-leftmost live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.

You can represent a live cell with an asterisk (*) and a dead cell with a dot (.).





const char VWALL = '|';
const char HWALL = '-';
const char LIVE='#';
const char DEAD='â€¢';

Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods: enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes it.


enqeueueueueue pushes to stack one, so stack one is a stack of everything
dequeueueueuueue pushes to stackzero everything popped from stackone, so stackzero is now a reversed stack of everything (ie fi to stackone is now fo from stackzero)
enqueueuue puts everything back to stackone before pushing of course



int stackone[32];

int sp1 = 0;
int sp0 = 0;

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.


char* encode(char* in){
	int idx = 0;
	int odx = 0;
	char* out;
	int ctr;
	while(in[idx+1] != EOL){
		if(in[idx+1] == in[idx])

			out[odx+1] = in[idx];
			odx += 2;

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, â‚¬, corresponds to the three bytes 11100010 10000010 10101100. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero. The other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.
Visually, this can be represented as follows.

 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
